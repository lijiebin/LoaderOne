# LoaderOne
A better PHP class file autoloader library than PSR.

## Why LoaderOne
- PSR autoload explanation so badly! Totally can't as a standard even or a suggestion because it too loosely and personalized customization.
- For the first reason, `Composer` is terrible too, it makes the PHP world messing.
- Conveniently to using and simply, scientific rules.
- Also good performance.
